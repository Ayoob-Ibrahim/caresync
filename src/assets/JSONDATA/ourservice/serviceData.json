To do this, your agency must first apply for a sponsorship licence from the Home Office. Once granted, you can issue a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) to each worker you intend to recruit. This approach can help fill staffing gaps and bring in diverse talent to your agency, but it requires a clear understanding of the immigration compliance system and possibly legal assistance to ensure all regulations are met."
